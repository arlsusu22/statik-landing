    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Statik ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application uses your data when you connect it with the Strava platform.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>Statik uses the Strava API to retrieve your activity data (maps, distance, time) solely for the purpose of generating visual overlays on your device. We do not permanently store your Strava activity data on our external servers. All image processing happens locally on your device or temporarily in memory to generate the image you requested.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p>We use Apple's In-App Purchase system and RevenueCat to manage subscriptions. We do not process or store your credit card information directly. Payment data is handled securely by Apple, and anonymous purchase identifiers are processed to verify your subscription status ("Pro" vs "Free").</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or monetize your personal movement data. Your activity data remains strictly between Strava and your device. Anonymous crash reports or usage metrics may be collected to improve app stability, but these are not linked to your identity.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>Since Statik does not create a user account or store your activity history on our servers, there is no account to delete. If you wish to revoke Statik's access to your data, you may disconnect the app via your Strava settings or simply uninstall the application.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@appstatik.com">support@appstatik.com</a></p>
